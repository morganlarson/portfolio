        My name is Morgan, as you may have already figured out. 
        <br><br>
        I'm originally from New Prague, Minnesota, but I'm currently living in Lincoln, Nebraska for school. I actually graduate this
        spring, in May 2024, which is really exciting! After I graduate, I will be going on a 6 week trip through various
        countries in Europe. I'm very excited! Once I get back, I'll be in full Maid of Honor mode for my older sister's wedding,
        which is in August. That will be super fun, but there is a lot left to do. The last big thing after that is me starting my job
        at Garmin! I have already accepted a full time offer from them, so I'm hoping to just enjoy the next few months of having
        minimal responsibilities.
        <br><br>
        I've included some pictures of Minnesota below!
