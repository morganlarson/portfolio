          Sat. May 4: 14 days out from graduation! I can't believe it's just 2 weeks away. That's wild! Luckily, I have my graduation cap and gown.
          Also, I recently found out that they don't read your name at graduation, you just walk up to get your diploma. That's kinda sad, in my opinion.

          Wed. May 1: I just did my senior presentation for engineering ambassadors. It was crazy going back through all of the pictures and seeing
          the entire past four years laid out that way. I've done a lot in college, and I'm very grateful for the experiences I've had. I've met so
          many people these past couple of years. I wouldn't be where I am without them.

          Sun. Apr. 28: This is basically the Sunday before my Dead Week. I say that because all of my final assignments (finals, presentations, etc.)
          are taking place during Dead Week. So, I don't have anything to do during finals week, but I have a lot to prep for the next two weeks.

          Sat. Apr. 27: Today's the spring game!! I'm not a big football fan, but this is the last college football game I'll go to where I'm still a
          college student. It'll be fun but also a little bittersweet. :)
